# Optimus Pipeline

This project dedicated to evaluation and utilization of the Optimus pipeline that initially developed by Broad Institut, which is a tool for the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. 

This pipeline is designed to be run on Terra, a cloud-based platform for biomedical research.

The evaluation of the pipeline is done by running it on a 10x 3' dataset and comparing the results with the HCA's results. The dataset used for this evaluation is the 10k PBMCs from a healthy donor dataset.
